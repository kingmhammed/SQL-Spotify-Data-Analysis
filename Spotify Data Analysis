# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1:What is the average danceability by artist and track?

SELECT artist_name, track_name,
Avg(danceability) AS AVG_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;


#2:Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT artist_name AS Artist, 
AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY Artist
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;


#3: What artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name AS Artist, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

#4:What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT track_name AS PopularSongs,
AVG(danceability) AS Avg_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY Avg_danceability DESC
LIMIT 10;


#5:What is the average energy of songs by each artist?

SELECT Distinct artist_name AS Artist, track_name AS Song,
AVG(energy) AS Avg_energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY Artist, Song
ORDER BY Avg_energy DESC;


#6:Which track has the highest danceability?

SELECT track_name, artist_name,
MAX(Danceability) AS  highest_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;


#7:How many tracks have a popularity score above 80?

SELECT COUNT(popularity) AS tracks_above_80
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 80;
